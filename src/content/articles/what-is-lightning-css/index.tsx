            <h2>What is Lightning CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                Lightning CSS is a blazing-fast CSS processor built in Rust.
                Originally made for the Parcel bundler, it’s now getting popular
                as it serves as the engine for Tailwind 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a modern alternative to tools like PostCSS, Autoprefixer,
                and CSSNano. It processes, transforms, and minifies CSS quickly.
                It also supports modern and experimental syntax very well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s what makes it powerful, whether you’re using Tailwind or
                not.
            </p>

            <h3>1. It’s fast—really fast</h3>
            <p>
                Lightning CSS is written in Rust, designed for performance.
                Compared to PostCSS and other JS-based processors, it’s
                significantly faster. Tailwind 4 saw massive speed boosts during
                builds thanks to this engine switch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benchmarks show Lightning CSS running 5–20x faster than
                traditional CSS processors.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Built-in CSS minification</h3>
            <p>
                No need for a separate minifier. Lightning CSS handles this by
                default, compressing your styles without extra tooling. It
                understands modern syntax like nesting, logical properties, and
                custom media queries.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Automatic vendor prefixing</h3>
            <p>
                Lightning CSS automatically adds vendor prefixes for your target
                browsers. This ensures wide compatibility without any extra
                setup. You set those targets with a Browserslist query. This can
                be in your package.json or in a separate .browserslistrc file.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Future-proof CSS features</h3>
            <p>
                Lightning CSS supports features from the CSS spec that haven’t
                fully landed in browsers yet. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>{`CSS nesting (.parent { & .child { ... } })`}</li>
                <li>Custom media queries</li>
                <li>Logical properties like margin-inline and padding-block</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This lets you write modern CSS now without waiting for browser
                support.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Tailwind 4 integration is seamless</h3>
            <p>
                If you’re using Tailwind CSS 4, you’re already using Lightning
                CSS under the hood. No extra setup. Faster builds, better
                support for new CSS syntax, and a leaner dependency tree.
            </p>

            <h3>6. It’s also a standalone tool</h3>
            <p>
                You can also use Lightning CSS without Tailwind. It works as a
                CSS bundler, minifier, or transformer in your build pipeline.
                Today's frontend stacks needs to prioritize performance and
                future-proof syntax. And lightning CSS check those boxes.
            </p>

            <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Lightning CSS is a modern rethink of how CSS tooling should
                work. Whether you choose Tailwind, create your own styles, or
                find a mix between the two. It’s worth learning. Faster builds
                and cleaner CSS await.

            <h2>How Tailwind Changed The Game... Again</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve been using Tailwind CSS since v2. At first, version 4 may
                look simple, but it has changed how I write CSS once again. From
                the first-class Vite plugin to the use of CSS variables for
                configuration, the improvements are impressive. If you’re still
                on version 3, you’re missing out on some powerful new
                capabilities.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Lightning CSS</h3>
            <p>
                First things first: PostCSS is gone. That might sound limiting.
                But you can still add PostCSS if you truly need it. In most
                cases, though, Lightning CSS and Vite cover 99% of real-world
                use. The upside? Faster builds. No more waiting on PostCSS to
                prune Tailwind’s output.
            </p>
            <p>
                {`Lightning CSS brings support for modern, future-facing CSS
                features. Features like native nesting, @propery and
                color-mix(). These tools aren’t nice-to-haves. They’re powerful
                building blocks for writing cleaner, more expressive styles
                today.`}
            </p>

            <h3>2. First Class Vite Integration</h3>
            <p>
                Tailwind 4 works out of the box with Vite. This tight
                integration makes use of Vite’s fast dev server, native ES
                module support, and instant HMR. Adding Tailwind CSS is now a
                simple task. Install a few plugins, update your Vite config and
                CSS, and you will be ready to proceed.
            </p>

            <h3>3. CSS As Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                Tailwind 4 moves away from traditional config files. It uses CSS
                variables as a main form of configuration. Define CSS variables
                for colors, fonts, and spacing instead of using
                tailwind.config.js. You can reuse these variables throughout
                your CSS. This makes your design system more flexible and easier
                to theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                This change simplifies dynamic theming. Now, adjusting colors
                for dark mode or user preferences is easier. Just update the
                variable! It also reduces rebuilds and improves interoperability
                with other styling layers. Tailwind now sees CSS as a live and
                adjustable runtime. It’s more than just precompiled output. It’s
                a foundational shift.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Modern CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Tailwind CSS 4 embraces the full power of modern CSS. It
                supports container queries. This lets components change based on
                their parent's size, not just the viewport. This enables more
                flexible, self-aware UI patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cascade layers give you control over utility, component, and
                custom styles. Now, you don’t need to use specificity hacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the selector side, Tailwind 4 (via Lightning CSS) enables
                advanced features like :not(), :is(), and :has(). These make
                targeting elements more expressive and conditional styling much
                easier.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Tailwind 4 doesn’t reinvent the framework. It might not be as
                flashy as JIT and arbitrary values. But, I believe Tailwind 4
                will go down as one of its more influential updates. It traded
                complexity for speed and flexibility. The result is a more
                modern, interoperable, and runtime-friendly toolset. You get
                faster builds. Smarter theming. Cleaner code. And deeper
                alignment with where CSS is going... not where it’s been. If
                you’ve been holding off on upgrading from v3, now’s the time.
                It’s worth it.
